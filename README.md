# Why-3 Library Manager

The `why3find` utility is dedicated to the management of Why-3 packages.

## Why-3 Packages

From `why3find` point of view, a why3 package is a collection of why3 source
files, configuration files and drivers that are installed at predefined site(s).

Packages are meant to have dependencies. Typically package `A` may depend on
why3 source files from some other package `B`. Hence, `why3find` knows how to
generate suitable options for `why3` to be able to find all the necessary sources.
Packages may also have extracted `OCaml` code.

Commands for browsing packages:

    $ why3find where       # location of global repository
    $ why3find shared      # location of why3find shared resources
    $ why3find list        # list all installed packages
    $ why3find query PKG   # details on package PKG

## Package Development

A typical Why-3 package project consists of user-edited files
and generated files from `why3find`.

A new package PKG (usually a lowercase identifier) is typically initiated
by the following command:

    $ why3find init PKG [DIR]

This will create a directory `DIR` (or `PKG` by default) with
some default files and directories. These files are intended to be
further edited by the package developpers:

    DIR/.gitignore     # Can be initiated by why3find init
    DIR/dune-project   # Can be initiated by why3find init
    DIR/PKG/**/*.mlw   # Why-3 source files of package PKG

The package directory will also be populated by generated files that contains
important data for your packages:

    DIR/why3find.json  # Package configuration, generated by why3find config
    DIR/dune           # Dune package installer, generated by why3find install
    DIR/META.json      # Package metadata, generated by why3find install
    DIR/PKG/**/proof.json  # Proof certificates, generated by why3find prove

Those files shall _not_ be edited by the package developers, but shall
be committed in your Git repository or any other version management system.

Finally, many others files will be generated during package development, but
it is _not_ recommended to commit them into your version management system:

    DIR/.why3find      # Prover cache, generated by why3find prove
    DIR/html/**        # Package documentation, generated by why3find doc
    DIR/lib/dune,*.ml  # OCaml extracted code, generated by why3find extract
    DIR/PKG/**/why3session.xml # Why-3 sessions (generated by why3find prove and why3)
    DIR/PKG/**/why3shapes.gz   # Why-3 shapes (generated by why3find prove and why3)

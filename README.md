# Why-3 Library Manager

The `why3find` utility is dedicated to the management of Why-3 packages.

## Why-3 Packages

From `why3find` point of view, a why3 package is a collection of why3 source
files, configuration files and drivers that are installed at predefined site(s).

Packages are meant to have dependencies, ie. package `A` may depend on
why3 source files from some other package `B`. Hence, `why3find` knowns how to
generate suitable options for `why3` to be able to find all the necessary sources.
Packages may also have extracted `OCaml` code.

## Package Development

The recommended setup for a new Why-3 package `PKG` is as follows:

1. First, run `why3find init PKG [DIR]` ; this will create templates for
   `Makefile`, `.gitignore` and `dune-project` that you can starts with.

2. Place your Why-3 source files in `DIR/PKG/**/*.mlw` directory ; the `PKG/`
   prefix is necessary to avoid `why3` name clashes between different packages.

3. Now, run `why3find config` to configure your why3 project.

A typical Why-3 package project will be structured as follows:

```
$ find DIR
DIR/dune-project   # Can be initiated by why3find init
DIR/dune           # Shall be updated by why3find install
DIR/META.json      # Shall be updated by why3find install
DIR/PKG/**/*.mlw   # This is where your Why-3 source files live
DIR/lib/dune,*.ml  # These files are generated by why3find extract
```
